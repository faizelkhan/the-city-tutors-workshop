The core of the assignment is a two-step process designed to move beyond passive content generation to active, critical evaluation.

**The Core Task Template**

1.  **Choose Your Focus:** Select a specific topic, theory, case study, or creative work relevant to this course (or your broader academic interests).
2.  **Generate with AI:** Use an AI tool (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity) to generate a specific type of content based on your chosen focus.
3.  **Evaluate & Critique:** Analyze the AI-generated output. Your evaluation should be detailed in a short report, addressing the following:
    * **Relevance & Accuracy:** How well does the output address the prompt? Are there factual errors, misinterpretations, or significant omissions?
    * **Specificity & Depth:** Is the output generic and superficial, or is it detailed, nuanced, and insightful? Does it provide concrete examples or evidence?
    * **Bias & Perspective:** What potential biases (e.g., cultural, political, ideological, data-driven) can you identify? Does the output present a single perspective as fact? Does it oversimplify complex issues?
    * **Originality & Usefulness:** Is the output a mere summary of existing information, or does it offer a novel connection or framing? How could this output be *used* as a starting point for genuine academic work?

### Task Ideas Across Different Disciplines

Here are specific ways to adapt this template for various fields, allowing students to choose a topic that genuinely interests them.

#### **For the Humanities & Social Sciences**

* **History:**
    * **Task:** "Choose a lesser-known historical event or figure. Use an AI tool to generate **a brief narrative (500 words) of the event or a biographical sketch of the figure.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Does the AI narrative impose a modern-day perspective on the past (presentism)? Does it rely on popular myths or does it align with academic consensus? Does it favor a "great man" theory of history or incorporate social and economic factors?

* **Literature/Film Studies:**
    * **Task:** "Select a complex character from a literary work or film you are studying. Use an AI tool to generate **an analysis of the character's central conflict and motivations.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Does the AI analysis resort to common tropes or clich√©s? Does it miss nuances or contradictions present in the text? Can you identify what sources (e.g., SparkNotes, Wikipedia) the AI likely synthesized, and how that flattened the interpretation?

* **Philosophy:**
    * **Task:** "Choose a classical philosophical concept (e.g., Plato's Forms, Kant's Categorical Imperative). Use an AI tool to generate **three modern-day scenarios that illustrate this concept in action.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Are the scenarios accurate applications of the philosophical concept, or do they oversimplify it? Do the scenarios contain implicit assumptions about ethics, society, or human nature? Are they genuinely insightful or just superficial analogies?

* **Sociology/Anthropology:**
    * **Task:** "Choose a contemporary social issue (e.g., gentrification, digital nomadism, the decline of third places). Use an AI tool to generate **three distinct perspectives on this issue from different stakeholders.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** How well does the AI capture the authentic voice and concerns of each stakeholder? Does it resort to stereotypes? Is the underlying analysis of power dynamics and social structures specific and well-defined, or is it vague?

#### **For STEM & Quantitative Fields**

* **Biology/Environmental Science:**
    * **Task:** "Select a specific ecosystem (e.g., a coral reef, a temperate forest) and a threat it faces. Use an AI tool to generate **a list of five potential bio-indicators that could be used to monitor the health of this ecosystem.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** How scientifically sound are the suggested indicators? Does the AI explain the mechanism by which each indicator relates to ecosystem health? Does it consider the practicality (e.g., cost, ease of measurement) of monitoring these indicators?

* **Computer Science/Ethics in AI:**
    * **Task:** "Propose a new application for AI in a field you care about (e.g., healthcare, education, finance). Use an AI tool to generate **a list of five potential ethical challenges or negative externalities associated with your proposed application.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Are the identified challenges specific to your application, or are they generic AI ethics concerns? Does the AI prioritize certain ethical frameworks (e.g., fairness, privacy, accountability) over others? How deep is the analysis of potential societal impact?

* **Health Sciences:**
    * **Task:** "Choose a complex health topic (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, the role of gut microbiome in mental health). Use an AI tool to generate **five 'frequently asked questions' (FAQs) with answers for a patient-facing website.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Is the medical information accurate and current? Is the language accessible and free of jargon? Does it address potential misinformation? Is there any bias in how it presents treatment options or lifestyle changes?

#### **For the Arts & Applied Fields**

* **Art History/Design:**
    * **Task:** "Choose an art movement or design style (e.g., Bauhaus, Surrealism, Brutalism). Use an AI tool to generate **a descriptive manifesto for a fictional new movement that is a reaction *against* your chosen style.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Does the AI manifesto demonstrate a genuine understanding of the style it is reacting against? Is the new vision coherent and specific? Does it create a caricature, or is there a plausible and creative core to the generated text?

* **Business/Marketing:**
    * **Task:** "Invent a fictional product. Use an AI tool to generate **a target audience profile (demographics, psychographics, pain points) for this product.**"
    * **Evaluation Focus:** Is the profile specific and actionable, or is it a collection of broad stereotypes? Does it reveal any biases about consumer behavior, gender, or age? How could this profile potentially lead a marketing team astray?
